## Week 1

### Plan 
- STARKS, SNARKS ..
- Circom, lot of circom
- Use circom to ship something of your choice
- Code Groth 16 in python
- Go through circom projects - Semaphore, Tornado Cash

### Updates
- Class 1 wasn't recorded. It was an introductory class.
- Class 2 : We discussed circom & snarks. 
- Class 3 : We discussed EDDSA, Elliptic Curves, BabyJubJub & Curta's puzzle #11.
- Class 4 : Live coded a buggy version of EDDSA Verifier in Circom. 
- Class 5 : Figured out how to use EScalarMul(), EScalarMulFix() from the iden3/circomlib library. 
- Class 6 : Went over Sets, Groups, Fields, Elliptic Curves. 

## Week 2

### Plan 
- Constructing SNARKs
- IOPs & PCS
- FRI & Advancements
- PLONK
- Code PLONK in Python
- More PLONK

### Updates
- Class 1 : Went over PCS, IOPs & PLONK
- Class 2 : Tried breaking down PLONK in python
- Class 3 : Dived into FRI video by RISC Zero
- Class 4 : Went over Reed Solomon Codes by RISC Zero
- Class 5 : A complete breakdown of PLONK ( Not recorded )

## Week 3

- Halo2 Circuit Layout
- Breakdown Halo2
- Build circuits : Fibonacci, Range Check & other simple ones
- Fields, Affine Points, groups, ECC
